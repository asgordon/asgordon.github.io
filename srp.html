      <h4>Collecting and analyzing millions of personal stories of everyday life</h4>
      <h3>1. Overview   </h3>

      <p>Over the last several years, my students and I have been developing technologies for collecting, analyzing, and reasoning with millions of personal stories extracted from Internet weblogs. </p>
      <p>For an overview of these efforts, see the following papers.</p>
      <ul class="publist">

International Conference on Knowledge Management, Special Track on Intelligent Assistance for Self-Directed and Organizational Learning, Graz, Austria, September 3-5, 2008. <a href="publications/IKNOW08.PDF">pdf</a></li>

      </ul>

      <h3>2. Large-scale story corpora</h3>
      <p>To facilitate the distribution of large-scale story corpora, our group has identified individual blog posts that contain personal stories within existing large-scale corpora of posts. Most recently, we identified nearly one million personal stories in the  ICWSM 2009 Spinn3r Blog Dataset, which we call the ICWSM 2009 Story Subset. Information about obtaining the The ICWSM 2009 Spinn3r Blog Dataset is available <a href="http://www.icwsm.org/data/">here</a>. To identify the story subset once you have this dataset, please use one of the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Version 1.0 (5/29/09) Initial release</li>
        <li><a href="downloads/icwsm09stories-1.1.zip">Version 1.1</a> (6/15/09) Fixed 1-off errors in both index file and java extractor</li>
        <li>Version 2.0 (12/21/09) Results using new classifier from Reid Swanson's PhD Dissertation</li>
        <li><a href="downloads/icwsm09stories-2.1.tgz">Version 2.1</a> (5/26/11) Made some syntax changes to the python extractor
          to achieve compatibility with Python 2.6+</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If you use this ICWSM 2009 Story Subset in your research, please send Andrew Gordon an email, and be sure to cite the following paper:</p>

      </ul>

      <h3>3. Reasoning with weblog stories</h3>
      <p>One of the primary aims of our work is to solve the problem of knowledge acquisition in commonsense reasoning. Below are papers that describe some of our previous attempts to exploit commonsense knowledge that exists within millions of weblog stories.</p>

      </ul>

      <h3>4. Related work</h3>
      <p>Several groups have pursued related work in automated story extraction from text. Some of the more recent work achieves higher accuracy than our efforts, and may be more promising as a basis for future work.</p>
